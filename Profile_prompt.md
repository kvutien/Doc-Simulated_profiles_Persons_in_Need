# Prompts and answers from DeepSeek V3 chatbot
### (February 2025)
The following is the transcript of a DeepSeek AI session to make it generate profiles of persons in neeed for the hackathon ETH Global Agentic Ethereum. https://chat.deepseek.com/
## Initial presentation
**My question**: *Before I formulate my request, let us proceed step by step. I will first explain my final objectives, then we'll talk about the actions that will be required to achieve the objectives, and we will see together the intermediate data that will be needed. Do you understand ? Do you have any question ?*

**Answer of DeepSeek**: Yes, I understand your approach. You plan to first explain your final objectives, then discuss the actions required to achieve those objectives, and finally identify the intermediate data needed along the way. This structured method will help ensure clarity and alignment as we work through your request.

I don’t have any questions at this stage, but I’m ready to listen to your objectives and proceed step by step. Please go ahead!

## 1. Presentation of the global helper context
**My question**: *I work in a global helper organization, bringing free assistance to persons in need. The persons in need have in general a monthly revenue of 50 USD, or equivalent in local currency. Some may have a little more, but they all have an incertain future and live day by day. Do you understand ? If you do, can you prove it by giving some examples of world recognized organizations that help these persons?*

**Answer of DeepSeek**: Yes, I understand your context. You work in a global organization that provides free assistance to individuals in need, typically those with very low monthly incomes (around $50 or equivalent) and uncertain futures. These individuals often live day-to-day and rely on external support for basic needs.

To prove my understanding, here are some examples of world-recognized organizations that help individuals in similar situations:

1. **The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)**  
   - Provides food assistance to millions of people living in poverty or affected by crises, often targeting those with very low incomes or uncertain futures.

2. **Oxfam**  
   - Works to alleviate global poverty by providing emergency relief, clean water, and long-term development programs for vulnerable communities.

3. **CARE International**  
   - Focuses on fighting poverty and providing humanitarian aid, particularly for women and girls in low-income communities.

4. **Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF)**  
   - Delivers medical care to people in crisis situations, including those living in extreme poverty or conflict zones.

5. **The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement**  
   - Provides emergency assistance, healthcare, and support to vulnerable populations, including those with very low incomes.

6. **Save the Children**  
   - Works to improve the lives of children and families living in poverty, often in regions with limited resources.

7. **BRAC**  
   - A development organization based in Bangladesh that provides support to people living in extreme poverty, including microfinance, education, and healthcare services.

These organizations are recognized globally for their efforts to assist individuals and communities living in poverty or facing uncertain futures, similar to the population you are helping. Let me know if you'd like to proceed to the next step!

## Further presentation of the persons in need context
**My question**: *All these persons in need can normally survive by themselves. They only need help to pass a period of hardship and in general to improve their livelihood. Examples of the persons in need can be small farmers or poor agricultural workers living in the countryside. They can be daily street workers living in huge cities. They can be refugees suffering from war or from disasters, earthquake, floods, droughts etc. They live in many countries in the world, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, India etc. Some have family and kids, some are bachelors. Some have schooling education, some are illiterate. For our purposes they need at least a simple mobile phone to do SMS messaging. If you understand, can you prove it by giving examples such kind of persons in need in some different countries worldwide and what they are suffering from? Give some countries where mobile phones are not available.*

**Answer of DeepSeek**: Yes, I understand your description of the persons in need and their circumstances. These individuals are typically self-reliant but face temporary or ongoing hardships that require external assistance to improve their livelihoods. They often live in challenging environments, such as rural areas or overcrowded cities, and may be affected by conflict, natural disasters, or economic instability. While many have access to basic mobile phones for SMS messaging, there are still regions where mobile phones are not widely available.

Here are examples of such persons in need in different countries worldwide, along with the challenges they face:

---

### **Examples of Persons in Need Worldwide**
1. **Small Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Kenya, Uganda)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Droughts, poor soil fertility, lack of access to modern farming tools, and fluctuating market prices.  
   - **Example:** A smallholder farmer in Kenya struggles to grow enough maize due to prolonged droughts and relies on aid for seeds and irrigation support.

2. **Daily Wage Workers in India (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Lack of stable employment, low wages, poor living conditions in slums, and lack of access to healthcare.  
   - **Example:** A construction worker in Mumbai lives in a slum and works irregularly, earning just enough to feed his family but unable to save for emergencies.

3. **Refugees in the Middle East (e.g., Syria, Yemen)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Displacement due to war, lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter, and limited opportunities for work or education.  
   - **Example:** A Syrian refugee family in a camp in Jordan struggles to find work and relies on humanitarian aid for survival.

4. **Poor Agricultural Workers in Latin America (e.g., Guatemala, Honduras)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Land inequality, low wages, and the impacts of climate change, such as hurricanes and floods.  
   - **Example:** A coffee plantation worker in Guatemala earns less than $3 a day and cannot afford proper housing or education for their children.

5. **Street Vendors in Southeast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Indonesia)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Lack of social security, vulnerability to natural disasters, and poor access to healthcare.  
   - **Example:** A street vendor in Manila sells snacks to tourists but struggles to make ends meet during the rainy season when business slows down.

6. **Disaster-Affected Families in South Asia (e.g., Nepal, Bangladesh)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Earthquakes, floods, and cyclones that destroy homes and livelihoods.  
   - **Example:** A family in Nepal lost their home in an earthquake and now lives in a temporary shelter, relying on aid for food and rebuilding support.

7. **Nomadic Herders in Central Asia (e.g., Mongolia)**  
   - **Suffering from:** Harsh winters (dzud), loss of livestock, and limited access to markets or healthcare.  
   - **Example:** A herder in Mongolia struggles to feed their family after losing most of their livestock to an extreme winter.

### **Countries or Regions Where Mobile Phones Are Not Widely Available**
While mobile phone penetration has increased globally, there are still areas where access is limited due to poverty, lack of infrastructure, or geographic isolation. Examples include:

1. **Remote Areas of Papua New Guinea**  
   - Many communities in the highlands lack access to mobile networks due to difficult terrain and poor infrastructure.

2. **Rural Parts of Afghanistan**  
   - Ongoing conflict and poverty limit access to mobile phones and networks in some regions.

3. **Parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., South Sudan, Central African Republic)**  
   - Poverty, conflict, and lack of infrastructure make mobile phones inaccessible for many.

4. **Indigenous Communities in the Amazon Rainforest (e.g., Brazil, Peru)**  
   - Geographic isolation and lack of infrastructure prevent access to mobile networks.

5. **North Korea**  
   - Strict government controls and poverty limit access to mobile phones for most citizens.

If you’d like, we can now move on to discussing the actions required to achieve your objectives and the intermediate data needed. Let me know!

## Summary of the presentation of needs
**My question**: *These persons in need are very heavily impacted by a smallest daily, or seasonal, variation in revenues. To carry out the assistance to persons in need, that is the mission of my organization, I need to know details of each person or each family. In our coming discussion, we will simulate that I work in one or another of the helper organizations. For each of the simulated situation, in an organization with a given mission, I will need different data. Some data are always needed for any person in need and for any helper organization, some data are collected for some kind of help and not for others, some data may be optionally collected, and some data are only known occasionally. So the key need is for free form profiles of persons in need. The profiles can be in local language but these languages must be understood by your current knowledge model. If you understand the complete explanation, refomulate and summarize exhaustively what I have said until now. What are my final objectives, what are the potential actions and what are the data needed to execute the actions?*

**Answer of DeepSeek**:  The server is busy. Please try again later.

**Answer of DeepSeek**:  Yes, I understand your explanation thoroughly. Let me reformulate and summarize your objectives, potential actions, and the data needed to execute those actions in a structured and exhaustive manner:

---

### **Final Objectives**
1. **Provide Targeted Assistance:** Deliver free assistance to persons in need (e.g., small farmers, daily wage workers, refugees, etc.) who are heavily impacted by small daily or seasonal variations in income.
2. **Improve Livelihoods:** Help these individuals or families overcome periods of hardship and improve their long-term living conditions.
3. **Adapt to Diverse Contexts:** Work across different regions, cultures, and circumstances (e.g., rural vs. urban, disaster-affected vs. conflict-affected) to provide tailored support.
4. **Leverage Mobile Technology:** Use SMS messaging via simple mobile phones as a primary means of communication and data collection.

---

### **Potential Actions**
To achieve the above objectives, the following actions may be required:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather detailed, free-form profiles of persons in need, including their personal, economic, and situational information.
2. **Needs Assessment:** Analyze the collected data to identify specific needs and vulnerabilities of individuals or families.
3. **Resource Allocation:** Distribute resources (e.g., financial aid, tools, training, or emergency supplies) based on the assessed needs.
4. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Track the impact of assistance and adjust programs as needed.
5. **Communication:** Use SMS messaging to stay in touch with beneficiaries, provide updates, and collect feedback.
6. **Collaboration:** Partner with local organizations, governments, or other NGOs to scale efforts and ensure cultural and contextual relevance.

---

### **Data Needed to Execute the Actions**
The data required can be categorized into four types:

#### **1. Always Needed (Core Data for Any Person in Need and Any Helper Organization)**
   - **Personal Identification:** Name, age, gender, family size, and relationship status (e.g., single, married, widowed).
   - **Contact Information:** Mobile phone number (for SMS communication) and location (village, city, or region).
   - **Economic Status:** Monthly income, primary source of income, and assets (e.g., land, livestock, tools).
   - **Basic Needs:** Access to food, water, shelter, and healthcare.

#### **2. Collected for Specific Types of Help (Context-Specific Data)**
   - **For Agricultural Support:** Type of crops grown, land size, access to irrigation, and challenges (e.g., pests, droughts).
   - **For Urban Workers:** Type of work (e.g., construction, street vending), daily earnings, and living conditions (e.g., slum housing).
   - **For Refugees:** Reason for displacement (e.g., war, disaster), current living situation (e.g., camp, host community), and legal status.
   - **For Disaster-Affected Families:** Type of disaster (e.g., earthquake, flood), extent of damage, and immediate needs (e.g., shelter, food).

#### **3. Optionally Collected (Useful but Not Always Necessary)**
   - **Education Level:** Literacy status, highest level of schooling, or vocational training.
   - **Health Information:** Chronic illnesses, disabilities, or access to medical care.
   - **Social Support:** Presence of family or community networks that can provide assistance.
   - **Cultural or Religious Practices:** Relevant for tailoring assistance to local customs.

#### **4. Occasionally Known (Situation-Dependent Data)**
   - **Seasonal Variations:** Changes in income or needs due to seasons (e.g., rainy season, harvest time).
   - **Crisis Events:** Sudden changes in circumstances (e.g., job loss, illness, or natural disaster).
   - **Feedback from Beneficiaries:** Opinions or suggestions on the effectiveness of assistance programs.

---

### **Key Considerations**
- **Free-Form Profiles:** Profiles should be flexible and adaptable to capture diverse and unique circumstances. They can be in local languages, provided they are within the scope of my knowledge model (e.g., widely spoken languages like Spanish, French, Hindi, Arabic, etc.).
- **Simulated Scenarios:** In our discussion, we will simulate working with different helper organizations, each with a specific mission. The required data will vary depending on the organization's focus (e.g., disaster relief, agricultural support, urban poverty alleviation).
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure that sensitive information is handled ethically and securely.

---

### **Summary of Your Request**
You aim to:
1. Build detailed, free-form profiles of persons in need to provide targeted assistance.
2. Simulate working with different helper organizations to understand the specific data requirements for each mission.
3. Identify core, context-specific, optional, and occasional data needed to execute assistance programs effectively.
4. Use SMS messaging as a primary tool for communication and data collection.

If this summary aligns with your goals, we can proceed to simulate specific scenarios and discuss the data requirements for each. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

## Scenario 1: Simulate 20 persons in need and World Food Program
**My question**: Let me know if generating 20 profiles in need is too many for you. Else let's assume in the following scenario that I work for the WFP. I need you to generate 20 profiles of persons in need. Put in the profiles realistic values for the parameters that you listed above: the always needed ones, the context-specific ones, the optionnally ones, the occasionnally ones. You may randomly miss some fields. The persons can live in any part of the world. If you happen to know the language of the country they live in, give the profile in this language, accompanied with an English translation.
