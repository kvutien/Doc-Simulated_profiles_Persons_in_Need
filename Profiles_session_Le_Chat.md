# 1. Presentation of the global helper context
## My question:
*I work in a global helper organization, bringing free assistance to persons in need. The persons in need have in general a monthly revenue of 50 USD, or equivalent in local currency. Some may have a little more, but they all have an incertain future and live day by day. Do you understand ? If you do, can you prove it by giving some examples of world recognized organizations that help these persons?*

## Answer of Le Chat:
Yes, I understand. You work in an organization that provides assistance to individuals with very low monthly incomes, typically around 50 USD or equivalent, who face uncertain futures and live day-to-day. These individuals are often in need of basic necessities and support to improve their living conditions.

Some well-known global organizations that provide assistance to such individuals include:

1. **Oxfam**: Focuses on alleviating poverty and providing humanitarian aid in various forms, including food, clean water, and education.

2. **Red Cross/Red Crescent**: Offers disaster relief, healthcare, and support to vulnerable communities worldwide.

3. **UNICEF**: Primarily focuses on the welfare of children, providing education, healthcare, and emergency aid to those in need.

4. **World Food Programme (WFP)**: Aims to combat hunger by distributing food assistance in emergencies and working on long-term solutions to hunger and poverty.

5. **Doctors Without Borders (MSF)**: Provides medical care to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters, or exclusion from healthcare.

These organizations work towards improving the lives of those living in poverty and facing hardship, often providing essential services and support to help them build a more stable future.
