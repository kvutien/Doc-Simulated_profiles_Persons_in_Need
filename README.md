# Simulated profiles of Persons_in_Need
Collects a set of simulated profiles of Persons_in_Need to use in Machu Picchu tests.

Here is an example of how these profiles can be used: https://medium.com/@kvutien-yes/hands-on-how-ai-can-help-persons-in-need-0fc5ca8e49a8

The profiles have been generated by a chatbox. As in reality of profile data collection by volunteers and by different organizations, the contents are unequally informed, the labels of the attributes may differ per profile. There is no strict rule in naming the files nor the attributes.

Each set of profiles is in a text file in markdown format
